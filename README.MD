# Welcome to the code repository for our Azure infrastructure as code series 💪💻

In this repository you will find the code examples used in our webcasts. During the Covid-19 pandemic we have covered infrastructure as code on Azure using [ARM Templates](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMe6dpu8mADJ1OV4usugfLK6yXY6hClQ5) and [Azure Bicep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wGMGId77OQ&list=PLMe6dpu8mADIrThzFA-WQwncXQ9BOzGVO)

## What is covered

In both languages, Bicep and the JSON based ARM templates we covered the following

- Basic authoring
- Advanced parameters
- Functions (looping, referencing, string functions ++)
- Nesting of templates (modularity)
- Pipelines (CI-CD)

Hopefully you will be able to follow all the code examples after wathcing the videos. If anything, feel free to reach out;
